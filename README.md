Here I'm learning about neural networks! Contents:
- digits/
  - A convolutional neural network trained on MNIST handwritten digits, then trying to recognize digits that I and others handwrote ourselves on paper, photographed with an iPhone, and chopped up / scaled.
- gpt/
  - Here I rewrote Andrej Karpathy's GPT implementations minGPT and nanoGPT as a learning exercise for myself. Closely based on the original code, with longer variable names and comments to help me get my head around it all. Includes an implementation of BPE.
  - Scripts to train and generate tiny shakespeare locally and on Lambda Labs are in `gpt/projects/tiny_shakespeare/scripts/`.
