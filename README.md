Here I'm learning about neural networks! Contents:
- digits/
  - A convolutional neural network trained on MNIST handwritten digits, then trying to recognize digits that I and others handwrote ourselves on paper, photographed with an iPhone, and chopped up / scaled.
- gpt/
  - Here I re-wrote Andrej Karpathy's GPT implementations [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) and [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) as a learning exercise for myself. Closely based on the original code, with longer variable names and comments to help me get my head around it all. Includes BPE.
  - Scripts to train and generate tiny Shakespeare locally (and on Lambda Labs) are in `gpt/projects/tiny_shakespeare/scripts/`.
